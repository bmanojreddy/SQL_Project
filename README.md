***SQL Projects Repository***
* Welcome to my SQL Projects repository!
*  This repository contains a collection of SQL projects that I've worked on, focusing on data analysis, querying, and database management.
*  Each project is designed to solve real-world problems using structured queries and provide insights through SQL.
* Each project folder contains the dataset (where applicable), SQL queries, and detailed explanations of the analysis performed.
* You can download or clone the repository and run the queries on your preferred SQL environment     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/mysql/mysql-original-wordmark.svg" alt="mysql" width="20" height="20"/>
